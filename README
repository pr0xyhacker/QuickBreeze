QuickBreeze is actually meant to be used as a script to create custom firmware.It can be easily used with later firmwares.The 4.2.1 firmware bundles are from msftguy.Basically its just sn0wbreeze in a nutshell.

P.S This creates 4.2.1 semi-tethered custom firmware for the iPod Touch 4 & iPhone 4 only
